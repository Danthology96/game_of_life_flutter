# Game of  Life in Flutter
Game of Life exercise made in flutter.

## Description

The game of life is a cellular automaton invented by the British mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game. 
Its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

You interact with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

##
The universe of the GoL is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively).

## Rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.

2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


# Acceptance Criteria

This exercise is made to implement the Design Patterns learned. The taks that needs to be done are the following:

1. Design:
   - Requirements and constraints.
   - Inputs/Outputs
   - High level Diagram of all the main objects.
3. Architect
   - Class diagram and the design patterns used on the application
   - Abstract the UI layer so it can be swapped.
4. Develop
   - Write the code for the application based on the architecture.
   - Document the code.

# Solution

1. Class diagram can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14fYykvq0w3jYKkWPGHHegkc5pmVvR-jO/view?usp=sharing
2. Code currently on development phase.
